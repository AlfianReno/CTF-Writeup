# OSINT

Open source intelligence, also known as OSINT, refers to the gathering of information from publicly available sources, such as social media, company websites, and news articles. There is a great deal of information that can be gathered about a company or person through open source intelligence.
In a cybersecurity context, OSINT can be used to recon a target before performing a penetration test or to generate a report of the information a company is leaking through public sources. Cyber criminals use OSINT to collect information on a target before attacking; also, OSINT can be used to help guess a user’s password. Many people use passwords that relate to themselves. For example, a common password creation method is to use the name of your favorite pet followed by the year you were born. This is a very poor password creation technique because this information is easy for a malicious user to obtain from openly available sources, such as your social media accounts. In addition to possible password information, OSINT can reveal information about a company’s internal computer network. For example, a company’s promotional website may include pictures of employees working. These pictures may reveal information about the company’s innerworkings, such as internal website URLs and private documents. OSINT can also be used to create a phony, malicious email targeting a company or individual; these phony emails are referred to as “phishing” emails.
